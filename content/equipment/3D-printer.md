##### Safety

1. Donâ€™t use this machine if you have not received training.

2. The surfaces can get hot! The extruder nozzle is small but it gets very hot when the printer is in use (up to 220 C or 400 F). The entire Build Plate may be up to 105C/202F depending on the File Settings. For PLA the build plate is typically set to a warm 50C/120F.

3. The instrument is a moving robot with many pinch points and it will suddenly start and stop. Once a print is started, keep hands out of the interior.

##### Operation

1. To be successful at operating a 3D printer, you need training, experience, and patience.

2. The 3D Printing Process: Model - Slice - Print.

3. Build file from the STL file with the correct machine settings and correct
extruder (left or right).

4. Save your file to the SD Card for the printer.

5. Make sure the machine is ready.

6. Make sure you have enough filament to complete the build.

7. Check to see if the machine is idle.

8. Check the build plate, it sould be empty and clean.

9. Make sure the build plate has adequate glue for the print to stick.

10. Once the build starts, ensure the first layer sticks and builds correctly.

11. Once the build is complete, safely remove it from the build plate and leave the machine ready for the next build.
